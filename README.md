# Differential Highlighter
This isn't the most efficient method of achieving this at all, but it works.

Paste or type in some text in the "Run Test.txt" file, and every portion you want compared to each other, separate it with a new line. 
Every line is comparted to the first line only. Run the .bat file, run the python script your own way.
